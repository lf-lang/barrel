# Lingo - A build tool for Lingua Franca programs
**Contact:** <tassilo-tanneberger@tu-dresden.de>

Lingo is a one-stop build tool for the Lingua Franca project. 
Lingo will manage your dependencies, configure build scripts and will potentially cross-compile for embedded platforms.


## Getting started
Lingo is a Rust project and is built with cargo. To install it, clone this repo and run `cargo install`:

```
git clone clone git@github.com:lf-lang/lingo.git
cargo install --path lingo
```

You will need at least version 1.83.0 of cargo. You can update it with `rustup update`.

## The command line interface

Usage: lingo [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  init    Initialize a Lingua Franca package
  build   Compile one or multiple binaries in a Lingua Franca package
  update  Update the dependencies and potentially build tools
  run     Build and run binaries
  clean   Remove build artifacts
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

## The toml-based package configurations
The Lingo.toml may look something like this.

```toml
[package]
name = "example_project"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["tassilo.tannerber@tu-dresden.de"]
homepage = "https://lf-lang.org"
license = "Weird Stallman License"
description = "A little Lingo.toml for people"

# a library exported by this LF Package
[lib]
name = "websocket"
location = "./src/lib"
target = "C"
platform = "Native"

[lib.properties]
cmake-include="./websocket.cmake"

# first binary in the project
[[app]]
name = "git-hook"
target = "cpp"
main = "src/Main.lf"

# replacement for target properties
[[app.properties]]
cmake-include = "./my-cmake.cmake"
logging = "info"

# dependencies
[[dependencies]]
mqtt = {version=">=0.1", git="https://github.com/LF-Community/mqtt.git", branch="main"}

```

## Supported Platforms

We mainly support Linux and MacOs, support for windows is secondary.
